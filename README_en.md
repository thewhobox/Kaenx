# Kaenx
Kaenx is an Open Source Software to configure KNX Devices.  
You will find the current development state in the german [Forum](https://knx-user-forum.de/forum/Ã¶ffentlicher-bereich/knx-eib-forum/diy-do-it-yourself/1672351-kaenx-open-source-inbetriebnahme-software). 
You can also report bugs and feature requests there.  
  
# Current State
Currently the software is an UWP-App so it only supports Windows 10/11.  
After the recoding with [UNO-Platform](https://platform.uno) (or [.NET Maui](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/what-is-maui)) it will also support Linux, MacOS, iOS and Android.  
There is no timeshift for the recoding. We will start with this after we can configure all KNX Devices with the software.    
  
# Installing
There are two ways to install the App:  
 - [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NX69NJ80X6T)  
    Only major releases
 - [App Installer File](https://kaenx.mikegerst.de)  
    Also small releases. Updates will be installed automatically.    
    It is mandatory to install the ["Publisher Certificate"](https://kaenx.mikegerst.de/Updater/Kaenx_0.0.55.0_Test/Kaenx_0.0.55.0_x86_x64.cer) as an administrator. The path has to be "Trusted Root Certification Authorities" on the local computer.

# Privacy
The app collects anonymized data about crashes and defined events.  
To do this we use App-Insights and App-Center (data will be deleted after 90 days).
